        Hey {{User}}, I have something very important to tell you. Google Has dedicated 1 Billion Dollars to giving the world <break strength='weak'/> Wait, it seems like there's something even more important.
        This just in...  Aliens have landed on Mount Wayupthar. They have hidden items in Hyrule and Zebes and have been ordered by Ganon and Mother Brain, the leaders, to take over the two worlds.
        They have captured Shaktool, of Maridia, who has enough diabetes supplies to last 48 hours. Someone must save him and the world from these evil invaders.
